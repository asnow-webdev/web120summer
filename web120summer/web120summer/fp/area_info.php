     <h3>Aesthetic Design</h3>
<p>First and foremost, the look and feel of the shopping cart page should continue on the theme from the main site.  “When there’s a visual disconnect between the checkout experience and the rest of your site, it can contribute to abandonment at the first step … by maintaining exact styles and keeping an identical look and feel, your site can prevent visitors from feeling visually alarmed. So, they will continue on as if everything is a part of one experience.”<sup>1</sup></p>

    <h3>Functional/Process Design</h3>
        <p>Staying with the KISS approach should inform your process design to further enhance the usability and stickiness of your shopping cart checkout page. </p> 
        <p><b>Display</b> – Use a table format to display the different sections of the checkout process on one page.  This can be achieved either in a column-format or row-format.  With the row-format, it is possible to use collapsible rows to keep process visibility while maintaining white space.</p>
        <p><b>Information gathering process</b> – In a general format, most shopping cart checkouts require the following information; Shipping Address, Billing Address, Shipping Method, and Payment Method.  It is recommended that the process should be in this order as well.  Also, while companies would like to associate any sale with a registered user, the checkout process should not be held up by insisting on log in or account creation if at all possible.  If they choose to checkout as a guest, then require their email in the shipping info which can be utilized for reporting and marketing later.</p>
