 <p>I am in the process of re-inventing myself.  I have been in the tech marketing space for well over a decade, but I am now taking my marketing skills and experience into new areas:  Web Development and Real Estate</p>
 <p>During my first quarter in the Web Development program at SCC I was also taking classes and getting my Real Estate license.  I am now part of a great team at a small brokerage in Seattle and working with my first few clients.  It is quite a change for me as it is a lot of Sales, which I don't have a lot of experience with, but I believe my approach and marketing experience will help me to succeed!</p>
 <p>Why Real Estate and Web Development?  Good question.  I chose these two paths as a means of supplementing each other.  Real Estate appeals to my marketing experience and the pleasure I get from helping others succeed.  But Real Estate can be up and down.  So, I thought that I could possibly supplement my Real Estate work with web dev work on the side.  Who knows, maybe it will turn out to be just the opposite; Real Estate supplementing my web development work.</p>
 <p>Either way, I am gaining experience in two new areas that show continued stability and growth.  Seattle is a hot market for both!</p>
